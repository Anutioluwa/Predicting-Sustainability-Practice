Objective: To analyze and predict sustainability practices among logistics companies over a six-year period.

Key Questions:
What are the most common sustainability practices?
How do sustainability practices trend over time?
Can we predict future adoption of sustainability practices?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize trends in sustainability practices over the years.
Calculate statistics to understand distributions, variances, and correlations.
Identify outliers and anomalies.

Feature Engineering
Create new features that might help in the analysis, such as a sustainability index or year-over-year change indicators.
Aggregate data if necessary to simplify patterns (e.g., total number of practices adopted).

Model Building
Clustering Model: Group companies into clusters based on their sustainability profiles.
Classification Model: Predict if a company will adopt a new sustainability practice in the next year.
Time Series Forecasting: Forecast the adoption of sustainability practices over time.

Model Evaluation
Use appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score for clustering, accuracy/precision/recall for classification, MAPE for time series forecasting).
Validate models using techniques like cross-validation.
